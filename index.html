            <p>Stephen Hawking is a theoretical physicist, author, and one of the most inspiring people alive today.
            Despite living with a physical disability that has paralyzed nearly every muscle in his body,
            he has had a brilliant career in theoretical physics and became a best selling popular science author.
            Stephen Hawking reminds me that no matter how daunting the challenges in our lives we are 
            capable of great things.</p>

            <p>Some interesting facts about Stephen Hawking:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>He is the former Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. This chair was
                held by Issac Newton in 1663.</li>
                <li>He speaks using a speech generating computer attached to a single cheek muscle.</li>
                <li>Hawking's work was the first to combine quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of general
                relativity in a meaningful way. This may be a step toward a unified theory of physics.</li>
                <li>He used quantum theory to show that black holes radiate heat, and therefore can eventually disappear. 
                    This phenonemon was named <em>Hawking Radiation</em> after him.</li>
                <li>He authored <em>A Brief History of Time</em> which was published in 1988.  The book became a best seller
                and has sold over 10 million copies.</li>
            </ul>
